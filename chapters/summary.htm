<p class="ct">CHAPTER SUMMARIES</p>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>ONE: IF YOU’RE SO RICH, WHY AREN’T YOU SO SMART?</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">An illustration of the effect of randomness on social pecking order and jealousy, through two characters of opposite attitudes. On the concealed rare event. How things in modern life may change rather rapidly, except, perhaps, in dentistry.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>TWO: A BIZARRE ACCOUNTING METHOD</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On alternative histories, a probabilistic view of the world, intellectual fraud, and the randomness wisdom of a Frenchman with steady bathing habits. How journalists are bred to not understand random series of events. Beware borrowed wisdom: How almost all great ideas concerning random outcomes are against conventional sapience. On the difference between correctness and intelligibility.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>THREE: A MATHEMATICAL MEDITATION ON HISTORY</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On Monte Carlo simulation as a metaphor for understanding a sequence of random historical events. On randomness and artificial history. Age is beauty, almost always, and the new and the young are generally toxic. Send your history professor to an introductory class on sampling theory.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>FOUR: RANDOMNESS, NONSENSE, AND THE SCIENTIFIC INTELLECTUAL</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On extending the Monte Carlo generator to produce artificial thinking and compare it with rigorous nonrandom constructs. The science wars enter the business world. Why the aesthete in me loves to be fooled by randomness.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>FIVE: SURVIVAL OF THE LEAST FIT—CAN EVOLUTION BE FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS?</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">A case study on two rare events. On rare events and evolution. How “Darwinism” and evolution are concepts that are misundderstood in the nonbiological world. Life is not continuous. How evolution will be fooled by randomness. A prolegomenon for the problem of induction.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>SIX: SKEWNESS AND ASYMMETRY</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">We introduce the concept of skewness: Why the terms “bull” and “bear” have limited meaning outside of zoology. A vicious child wrecks the structure of randomness. An introduction to the problem of epistemic opacity. The penultimate step before the problem of induction.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>SEVEN: THE PROBLEM OF INDUCTION</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On the chromodynamics of swans. Taking Solon’s warning into some philosophical territory. How Victor Niederhoffer taught me empiricism; I added deduction. Why it is not scientific to take science seriously. Soros promotes Popper. That bookstore on Eighteenth Street and Fifth Avenue. Pascal’s wager.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>EIGHT: TOO MANY MILLIONAIRES NEXT DOOR</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">Three illustrations of the survivorship bias. Why very few people should live on Park Avenue. The millionaire next door has very flimsy clothes. An overcrowding of experts.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>NINE: IT IS EASIER TO BUY AND SELL THAN FRY AN EGG</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">Some technical extensions of the survivorship bias. On the distribution of “coincidences” in life. It is preferable to be lucky than competent (but you can be caught). The birthday paradox. More charlatans (and more journalists). How the researcher with work ethics can find just about anything in data. On dogs not barking.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>TEN: LOSER TAKES ALL—ON THE NONLINEARITIES OF LIFE</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">The nonlinear viciousness of life. Moving to Bel Air and acquiring the vices of the rich and famous. Why Microsoft’s Bill Gates may not be the best in his business (but please do not inform him of such a fact). Depriving donkeys of food.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>ELEVEN: RANDOMNESS AND OUR MIND: WE ARE PROBABILITY BLIND</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On the difficulty of thinking of your vacation as a linear combination of Paris and the Bahamas. Nero Tulip may never ski in the Alps again. Do not ask bureaucrats too many questions. A Brain Made in Brooklyn. We need Napoleon. Scientists bowing to the King of Sweden. A little more on journalistic pollution. Why you may be dead by now.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>TWELVE: GAMBLERS’ TICKS AND PIGEONS IN A BOX</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">On gamblers’ ticks crowding up my life. Why bad taxi-cab English can help you make money. How I am the fool of all fools, except that I am aware of it. Dealing with my genetic unfitness. No boxes of chocolate under my trading desk.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>THIRTEEN: CARNEADES COMES TO ROME: ON PROBABILITY AND SKEPTICISM</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">Cato the censor sends Carneades packing. Monsieur de Norpois does not remember his old opinions. Beware the scientist. Marrying ideas. The same Robert Merton putting the author on the map. Science evolves from funeral to funeral.</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1"><span class="dis"><small><b>FOURTEEN: BACCHUS ABANDONS ANTONY</b></small></span></p>
<p class="tx1">Montherlant’s death. Stoicism is not the stiff upper lip, but the illusion of victory of man against randomness. It is so easy to be heroic. Randomness and personal elegance.</p></div>
