<p class="ata">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</p>
<br/>
<p class="tx1">N<small>ASSIM</small> N<small>ICHOLAS</small> T<small>ALEB</small> is a literary essayist, multidisciplinary scholar, and former trader obsessed with the multidisciplinary problems of uncertainty. His interests lie at the juncture of philosophy, mathematics, business, and the social sciences, but he has stayed extremely close to the ground thanks to an uninterrupted two-decade career as a quantitative trader and risk manager in New York and London.</p>
<p class="tx">Taleb is the former Dean’s Professor in the Sciences of Uncertainty at the Isenberg School of Management of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He also taught at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University. His degrees include an MBA from the Wharton School and a Ph.D. from the University of Paris.</p>
<p class="tx">In addition to his scientific and literary interests, Taleb’s hobby is to poke fun at those who take themselves and the quality of their knowledge too seriously. His work has been published in twenty-seven languages (even French) and has more than a million readers. He lives mostly in New York.</p></div>
